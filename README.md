# dotnet-config-template

A .NET CLI tool that generates template configuration files from your user secrets and local settings with placeholder values for team sharing.

## Why?

Projects should be ready to run when checked out, without having to ask teammates for their local settings or scan through code to figure out what secrets you need. This tool ensures that developers don't have to rebuild configuration that other teammates already set up - just clone, set your values, and go.

## What it does

- Reads your existing user secrets and local settings
- Generates template files with placeholder values (not sure about the format yet)
- Supports both ASP.NET Core (`appsettings.json`) and Azure Functions (`local.settings.json`)
- Helps teams document required configuration without committing secrets
