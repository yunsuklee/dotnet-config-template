# dotnet-config-template

A .NET CLI tool that generates template configuration files from your user secrets and local settings for easier team sharing.

## Why?

Projects should be ready to run when cloned, without asking teammates for local settings or digging through code to find required secrets. This tool prevents developers from rebuilding configuration that others already set up and eliminates the risky practice of sharing secrets over chat - just clone, set your values, and go.

## What it does

- Reads your existing user secrets and local settings
- Generates template files with placeholder values (not sure about the format yet)
- Supports both ASP.NET Core (`appsettings.json`) and Azure Functions (`local.settings.json`)
- Helps teams share required configuration without committing secrets nor exposing them through chats
